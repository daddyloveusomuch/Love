            <p>Look at me. I know you’re tired. I know it feels hard right now. But I also know exactly what you are capable of.</p>

            <p>You have a fire in you that amazes me. Don’t let a bad day convince you that you have a bad life. You’re building our future, step by step.</p>

            <p>Chin up, Cat. You’ve got this. Crush it today, show them who you are, and remember who’s cheering for you the loudest.</p>
