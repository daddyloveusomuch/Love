            <p>If I were there, I’d hold your face in my hands and kiss every tear away until you smiled again. It hurts me to know you’re hurting.</p>

            <p>It’s okay to feel small sometimes. It’s okay to cry. But never forget that even when you feel weak, you are the strongest person I know.</p>

            <p>You are my precious girl, and nothing in this world can break you. Take a moment, let it out, and then take a deep breath. Everything is going to be okay. I promise.</p>
