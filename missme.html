            <p>Come here, my little cat. I know the bed feels a little too big and the room feels a little too quiet right now. I know your chest aches because mine does too.</p>

            <p>But listen to me: <strong>Distance is just a test to see how far love can travel, and ours has no limits.</strong></p>

            <p>Close your eyes for a second. Imagine I’m standing right behind you, wrapping my arms around your waist and pulling you into my chest. You are safe. You are loved. And sooner than you think, you won’t have to imagine it anymore.</p>

            <p>Be a good girl and stay strong for Daddy. We’re one day closer than we were yesterday.</p>
